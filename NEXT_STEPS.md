We hope you enjoyed our introduction to the world of programming. Our team uses a wide variety of tools to try and solve complex problems in healthcare. We're really excited to have the opportunity to show you a small slice of the toolkit we use to tackle these tough problems.

The best part about our job is the wide variety of tools and technologies that we get to use to solve these problems and their low barrier to entry. Whether you're crunching a huge set of numbers, manipulating imagery, or building a sleek new web application. It's amazing how easy it is to get started coding new solutions to tough problems -- no matter what those problems might be and no matter how much experience you might have trying to solve them.

Today we got started writing code and manipulating images in python, we coded a web page with HTML, and styled it with CSS. We also included some additional javascript in our demo that we encourage you to explore after our workshop. Javascript allows a coder to dynamically alter the content of a web page beyond what standard HTML might allow. Most of the websites you visit today make heavy use of javascript to create dynamic, interactive user interfaces. Take a look at the "javascript" tab in our demo for an example of that interactivity.

If this quick tutorial was at all interesting to you and you're looking to learn more, then good news! There are a ton of resources online for you to dig in and start learning more about programming.

Whether you'd like to build a new game, automate a repititive task, create an amazing web page, or dive into an interesting set of data, there are a variety of tools and techniques that you can learn to build something awesome. Seriously, you can do it!

Check out the list below for some helpful resources that will help you on your journey to building the "Next Big Thing"!


### The Basics

* Python - An easy to learn programming language with a ton of capabilities. We got to play with a bit of python code today. Checkout our the [releases](https://github.com/chop-dbhi/backtoschool/releases) section of our github repository to download a version of the Python GUI we used today on your own computer.
  * iPython - write python scripts in your browser!
* Web Technologies (HTML/Javascript/CSS)
* Git - "Source code management" Keep track of the changes you make to your code. Make it easy to share your code and collaborate with other programmers
* Github - A website that makes it easy to share git repositories. Check github for a wealth of example code from a wide variety of organizations (CHOP, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc.)

### Online Learning

* [Coursera](http://coursera.org) (Mostly free)
* [Codeacademy](http://www.codeacademy.com) (Mostly Free)
* [edX.org](http://edX.org) (Free)
* [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com) ($)

### Web Programming
So many applications that we use every day now live on the web. The web provides a fantastic platform for developing tools whether you are using a mac, pc, or mobile device. Many of these applications utilize a wide variety of technologies. Usually these technologies are broken into two categories "Backend" -- which is the server code that pushes web pages to the browser or "Frontend" which is client code that runs in your web browser. Generally, python is used to create "Backend" code, and HTML+CSS+Javascript can be used to create "Frontend" applications. Javascript is unique in that you can create *both* the server code (using a framework called [node.js](https://nodejs.org)) and the client code with one language.

At CHOP many of our applications "Backend" code is written using python, and our "Frontend" code is a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Take a look at our github page for examples of our work.

* [Django](http://djangoproject.com) Full featured web framework. This project is a good place to start. You'll find that working with django you'll touch on a lot of interesting technologies: html/css/javascript, web APIs, databases, etc.
* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) Like django but with not as many bells and whistles.
* [Twitter's Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) HTML + CSS + Javascript framework used to quickly develop professional looking web pages.
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com) A javascript library with excellent documentation that simplifies

### The Gamer
Most people enjoy playing games. Whether they're on a console, computer, your phone or your browser, sometimes its nice to kick back and play.


* [PyGame](http://pygame.org) - a toolkit that makes creating games in python easy and fun.
* (HTML5 + Javascript + CSS)[http://www.html5gamedevelopment.com/]
  * quintus
  * RPG.js - Create 2.5D Bitmap based "Zelda-like" games
