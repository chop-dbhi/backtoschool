History and License
*******************


History of the software
=======================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl/) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see
http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/) in Reston, Virginia where he released
several versions of the software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation; see http://www.zope.com/).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-
profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of the
PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org/
for the Open Source Definition). Historically, most, but not all,
Python releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below
summarizes the various releases.

Note: GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under the
  GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a
  modified version without making your changes open source. The GPL-
  compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with other
  software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways.    You may not work around any technical limitations in the software.  For example, Microsoft has technically limited or disabled extensibility for the software, and so you may not extend the software by, among other things, loading or injecting into the software any non-Microsoft add-ins, macros, or packages; modifying the software registry settings; or adding features or functionality equivalent to that found in other Visual Studio products.

You also may not

You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software.  These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use.  For additional information, see www.microsoft.com/exporting.

13.	SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is âas is,â we may not provide support services for it.

14.	Entire Agreement.  This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.

15.	Applicable Law.

a.	United States.  If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles.  The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.

b.	Outside the United States.  If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.

16.	Legal Effect.  This agreement describes certain legal rights.  You may have other rights under the laws of your country.  You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software.  This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.

17.	Disclaimer of Warranty.   The software is licensed âas-is.â  You bear the risk of using it.  Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees or conditions.  You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this agreement cannot change.  To the extent permitted under your local laws, Microsoft excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.

18.	Limitation on and Exclusion of Remedies and Damages.  You can recover from Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. $5.00.  You cannot recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental damages.

This limitation applies to

Â·	claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.  The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
