# DBHi Back to School Tutorial Curriculum

This an introduction to bioinformatics programming for high school age students. It walks students from a "Hello World" style script to a creating a dynamic webpage to manipulate a medical image. This is not intended as a full introductory course to programming concepts, but rather a view into what is possible. We've chosen to use a CGI script because it is a very simple way to quickly migrate the students from printing text to the screen to outputting text to a webpage. This tutorial is intended to run approximately two hours so we have placed an emphasis on simplicity. Each student or team of students can run through the entire tutorial on a Raspberry PI.


# Proposed Curriculum Outline

1. Introduce students to the Raspberry PI hardware.
2. Introduce students to Python using the Python Coding GUI
3. Introduce students to HTML/CSS using one of the following
    1. Text Editor and Browser
    2. Google Coder Raspberry PI image
    3. [miniCodeEditor](https://github.com/xem/miniCodeEditor). Checkout minicodeeditor branch. Run git submodule init, git submodule update. Then run server.py followed by start_edit.sh to see how this would work.
    4. [Editr.js](https://github.com/Idered/Editr.js/tree/master). Checkout editr branch. Run git submodule init, git submodule update. Then run server.py and go to http://localhost:8000 in the browser to see a demo of this. It looks pretty slick but pushes the limits of the PI's browser when using the code editor.
    5. [TinkerPad](https://github.com/tomhodgins/tinkerpad) looks promising. No demo yet, but see [here](http://staticresource.com/tinkerpad/).
