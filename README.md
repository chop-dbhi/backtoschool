# DBHi Back to School Tutorial Curriculum

This an introduction to bioinformatics programming for high school age students. It walks students from a "Hello World" style script to creating and modifying a webpage. This is not intended as a full introductory course to programming concepts, but rather a view into what is possible. This tutorial is intended to run approximately two hours so we have placed an emphasis on simplicity. Each student or team of students can run through the entire tutorial on a Raspberry PI.


# Curriculum Outline

1. Introduce students to the Raspberry PI hardware.
2. Introduce students to Python and image processing using the Python Coding GUI
3. Introduce students to HTML/CSS using an in-browser HTML/CSS/JavaScript editor. 

# Links to Software
