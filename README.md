# DBHi Back to School Tutorial Curriculum

This an introduction to bioinformatics programming for high school age students. It walks students from a "Hello World" style script to a creating a dynamic webpage to manipulate a medical image. This is not intended as a full introductory course to programming concepts, but rather a view into what is possible. We've chosen to use a CGI script because it is a very simple way to quickly migrate the students from printing text to the screen to outputting text to a webpage. This tutorial is intended to run approximately two hours so we have placed an emphasis on simplicity. Each student or team of students can run through the entire tutorial on a Raspberry PI.


# Curriculum Outline

1. Introduce students to the Raspberry PI hardware.
2. Introduce students to Python and image processing using the Python Coding GUI
3. Introduce students to HTML/CSS using an in-browser HTML/CSS/JavaScript editor.
